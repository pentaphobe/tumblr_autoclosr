# Tumblr Autoclosr

Very simple extension for Google Chrome which auto-closes Tumblr's "celebration" window after posts complete.

_not much more to say, as this is just a personal pet peeve..._


## Roadmap

[ ] add a gruntfile for packaging
[ ] add an icon
[ ] chuck it up in case one other person wishes to use this
